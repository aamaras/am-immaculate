## The day

We're getting married on **Thursday 6 October 2016** at [Cullen Wines](http://www.cullenwines.com.au/) in Margaret River. The ceremony and reception will both be at Cullen, starting from mid afternoon. We'll publish exact timings on this page shortly.

## The week

We'll be in Margaret River from **Tuesday 4 October** to **Friday 7 October**. You don't have to come down that early, but we'd love to see you if you do. We'll organise a dinner somewhere on the Wednesday for anyone who is already in Margaret River.

## The weekend after

On **Sunday 9 October** there'll be a picnic in Kings Park in Perth with our extended families. The picnic will be at the [Old Tea Pavilion](http://www.bgpa.wa.gov.au/kings-park/events/bookings/hire-venues/old-tea-pavilion) from **11:30am**. The picnic will be a relaxed BYO affair. We would love to see you there if you're still in Perth.

## Before the day

Go to the [RSVP page](http://aaronellen.wedding/rsvp.html) and tell us your plans **before 6 August**. We can use this information to do things like help find people lifts down to Margaret River and organise transport to and from Cullen on the day.

The best gift you could give us is to be there on our wedding day, and we know some of you are travelling a long way to be there. That means gifts are optional! If you would still like to give us something, we have set up a [wine registry](https://www.wineplease.com.au/wedding-registry/ellen-aaron-wedding) (because wine is tastier than towels).

We can't wait to see you in October.
